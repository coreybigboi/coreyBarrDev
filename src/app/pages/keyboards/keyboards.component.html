        <h1>Why I am Passionate about Keyboards</h1>
        <p>
            I type a lot, both for my job and in my free time. This can be anywhere from six to ten hours per day, which
            adds up very quickly. I never thought about keyboards much until recently when I fell down the rabbit hole
            of ergonomic keyboards. I had always thought developing RSI and Carpal Tunnel syndrome were an inevitable
            consequence of being a nerdy programmer, like how a chemical researcher must accept that their lungs will
            turn into a toxic mess, or a boxer knows that their brain will shrivel into a black lump.

            Luckily we can avoid a future of painful wrists by bursting from the bubble of conventional keyboards!

        <h1>Sins of Conventional Keyboards</h1>
        <p>Traditional keyboards make no sense in many ways. Some of the biggest blunders are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each row is horizontally staggered, which makes it awkward to reach many keys (especially the number
                row).</li>
            <li>Your hands are forced to be very close together while typing, which is bad for both your wrists and
                shoulders.</li>
            <li>Most keyboards let you tilt the back of the keyboard up. This is terrible for your wrists.</li>
        </ul>

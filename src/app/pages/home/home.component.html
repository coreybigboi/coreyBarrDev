        <p>I am currently in a D&D campaign where I am playing as a 3/4 orc (mum was an orc, dad was a half-orc) named <b>Grug</b>, who is a fearsome fighter. He has embarked on a death pilgrimage, where hopes to find an honorable death 💀</p>
        <p>You can find the history of Grug <a href="https://github.com/coreybigboi/dndGrug">here</a>.</p>
